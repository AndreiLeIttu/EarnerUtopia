# Earner Utopia
This is Earner Utopia, an Android App meant to be an extension to the existing Uber-Driver app that enhances Earners' experience by taking into account both the money-making and the wellness aspects.

# Problem and Solution
Earners can, in the current Uber application, input their preferred destinations, as well as plan their day based on the areas that are predicted to make them the most money. However, the 
wellness of earners is not currently a priority. 

This is where our companion comes in. We aim to enhance the earner experience through a daily plan based on their preferred schedule, and other wellness-related factors such as 
their tiredness levels, minimizing the idle times between orders, bad weather, and other similar factors. We also provide a floating widget that notifies the driver when they are recommended to take a break from
driving, as well as suggestions to take cover in case of bad weather predictions.

# Getting started
1. In order to run this application, you need to install Android Studio.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to ensure you have all the required python packages installed
3. In the terminal, navigate to `./app/predictors` and run the following command: `python server.py`
4. After cloning and opening the project directory in Android Studio, you can now run the project, either on one of your Android devices, or on a virtual device.
